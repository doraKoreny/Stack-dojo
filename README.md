# Stack-dojo
Project Overview:

- This project's purpose is to understand how a stack works.
- Practice TDD (Test Driven Development)

Requirements:

- It should be a static stack, he size should be given in the constructor (no default constructor allowed)
- Push functionality (add an item to the stack)
- Pop functionality (remove an item)
- Peek functionality (receive the top item without removing it from the stack)
- Get the size of the stack (the number of elements in the stack).
- Throw an exception when the stack is full and I want to add one more item
- Throw an exception when the stack is empty and I want to pop an item
- Add Unit tests
